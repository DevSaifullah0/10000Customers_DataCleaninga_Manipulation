This project involves cleaning and standardizing a customer details dataset containing 10,000 records. The main tasks include removing special characters and formatting inconsistencies in phone numbers, adding standardized country codes, handling missing values, and eliminating duplicate records to ensure data accuracy. Additional cleaning was performed on the “Notes” column by replacing placeholder text with null values for better analytical quality. The result is a well-structured, duplicate-free dataset ready for analysis or integration into business applications.
